## ✅ 1. Introduction to SIEM  
**🧩 Description:**  
An introduction to **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**.  
SIEM solutions aggregate log data from multiple sources, analyze it in real-time, and help detect anomalies or threats.

**📌 Key Concepts:**
- What is a SIEM?
- How SIEM helps in threat detection and response
- Common SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk, ELK, IBM QRadar)
- Log collection, parsing, and correlation
- Real-time alerts and dashboards

**🛠️ Hands-on Experience:**
- Understand log types and sources
- Basic querying in SIEM
- Alert triage simulation

## ✅ 2. Firewall Fundamentals  
**🧩 Description:**  
Learn the purpose and operation of **firewalls**, and get hands-on with both Windows and Linux built-in firewalls.

**📌 Key Concepts:**
- What is a firewall?
- Types of firewalls: Packet filtering, Stateful, Proxy
- Rules and policies (Allow/Deny/Drop)
- Inbound vs Outbound traffic
- Default-deny strategies

**🛠️ Hands-on Experience:**
- Configure Windows Defender Firewall with advanced settings
- Use `ufw` and `iptables` on Linux to control traffic
- Test firewall effectiveness using simulated attacks

## ✅ 3. IDS Fundamentals  
**🧩 Description:**  
Introduction to **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and practical usage with **Snort**, a popular open-source IDS.

**📌 Key Concepts:**
- Difference between IDS and IPS
- Types: Network-based IDS (NIDS) vs Host-based IDS (HIDS)
- Detection methods: Signature-based, Anomaly-based
- Alert classifications and severity levels
- Deployment considerations

**🛠️ Hands-on Experience:**
- Install and configure Snort
- Analyze alert logs generated by Snort
- Write custom Snort rules to detect specific activity

## ✅ 4. Vulnerability Scanner Overview  
**🧩 Description:**  
Learn about how **vulnerability scanners** work, their role in identifying system weaknesses, and see how they are used in a practical scenario.

**📌 Key Concepts:**
- What is a vulnerability?
- How scanners like **Nessus**, **OpenVAS**, and **Nikto** operate
- CVSS scoring and severity classification
- False positives and scan tuning

**🛠️ Hands-on Experience:**
- Run a basic vulnerability scan on a target system
- Interpret scan results and prioritize risks
- Learn remediation steps for high-severity findings
