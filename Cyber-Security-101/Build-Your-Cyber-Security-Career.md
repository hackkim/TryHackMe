## 🔐 1. Security Principles

![Security Principles Module](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a386bef7-a2c6-42c2-bcf6-315911f382fa)

### 🔎 CIA Triad

| Principle       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized individuals |
| **Integrity**       | Protecting information from being altered or tampered with |
| **Availability**    | Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed |

### 🛡️ Additional Core Principles

- **Least Privilege**: Users should have the minimum access necessary to perform their job.
- **Defense in Depth**: Layered security approach with multiple controls.
- **Separation of Duties**: Prevents abuse of privileges by dividing tasks among personnel.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Default to denying access unless explicitly allowed.
- **Security Through Obscurity**: Not a replacement for strong security—used only as a minor enhancement.

### 📚 Security Models

- **Bell-LaPadula Model**: Focuses on confidentiality (used in government systems).
- **Biba Model**: Emphasizes data integrity.
- **Clark-Wilson Model**: Commercial model focusing on well-formed transactions and integrity.
