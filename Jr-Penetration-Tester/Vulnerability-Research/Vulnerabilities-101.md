# 🔐 Vulnerabilities 101 - Summary

This module provides a foundational understanding of vulnerabilities in cybersecurity and how to research, assess, and exploit them during penetration testing engagements.

---

## ✅ Task 1 - Introduction

Vulnerabilities are flaws in system design, implementation, or behavior that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or perform unauthorized actions.

### Key Topics:

* What vulnerabilities are
* Why they matter
* Vulnerability scoring methods (CVSS & VPR)
* Online databases for research
* Practical exploitation example (ACKme)

---

## 🧰 Task 2 - Introduction to Vulnerabilities

A **vulnerability** is a weakness that can be exploited. According to NIST, it is a "weakness in an information system... that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source."

### 🔍 Five Common Categories:

| Type                     | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Operating System         | Leads to privilege escalation, found in OS internals            |
| (Mis)Configuration       | Caused by incorrect setup, e.g., exposed sensitive data         |
| Weak/Default Credentials | Easy-to-guess login credentials, often left unchanged by admins |
| Application Logic        | Poorly implemented features, like flawed authentication         |
| Human-Factor             | Phishing and social engineering that exploit human behavior     |

## 🌐 Task 3 - Scoring Vulnerabilities (CVSS & VPR)

### ⚖️ CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

* Open-source
* Uses metrics based on **exploitability**, **impact**, and **severity**

| Rating   | Score Range |
| -------- | ----------- |
| None     | 0.0         |
| Low      | 0.1 - 3.9   |
| Medium   | 4.0 - 6.9   |
| High     | 7.0 - 8.9   |
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0  |

**Limitations:** Doesn't prioritize risk; scoring is mostly static.

### 📊 VPR (Vulnerability Priority Rating)

* Developed by **Tenable**
* Scores based on **risk to the organization**, **software relevance**, and **exploit age**

| Rating   | Score Range |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Low      | 0.0 - 3.9   |
| Medium   | 4.0 - 6.9   |
| High     | 7.0 - 8.9   |
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0  |

**Strengths:** Real-time scoring, context-aware, dynamic updates
**Drawbacks:** Closed-source, only available via Tenable platform

## 📃 Task 4 - Vulnerability Databases

Understanding how to locate and leverage known vulnerabilities is essential. Two commonly used resources are:

### 1. 🌐 NVD (National Vulnerability Database)

![NVD Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/322ffbb8-b2fa-443b-b677-f001b9c04f8d)

* Stores all public **CVEs** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
* Format: `CVE-YYYY-XXXXX`
* Good for documentation, not optimal for finding practical exploits

### 2. 🔧 Exploit-DB

![Exploit-DB Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f339804b-0c44-4c0c-9eec-96657d14d994)

* Hacker-focused repository of **exploits** and **proof of concept (PoC)** code
* Search by software name, version, or author
* Extremely helpful in real-world assessments

| Term          | Definition                                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Vulnerability | A weakness that can be exploited                |
| Exploit       | Action or code used to leverage a vulnerability |
| PoC           | Demonstration that an exploit works             |

## 🔎 Task 5 - Example: Apache Tomcat

**Scenario:**

1. Identify version via "Version Disclosure" vulnerability (e.g., `Apache Tomcat 9.0.17`)

![Apache Tomcat Version Disclosure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e22a6597-2ffd-43d5-8a15-7e375bc95c50)

2. Use **Exploit-DB** to search for that version

![Exploit-DB Tomcat Search Results](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93e3cee6-53b0-42fe-8b37-93c26bed94fd)

**Outcome:**

* Found 5 usable exploits for Apache Tomcat 9.0.17
* Demonstrates how minor findings can escalate into full exploit chains

## 👨‍💼 Task 6 - Showcase: Exploiting ACKme

As a Jr. Penetration Tester at ThePentestingCo, you shadow a Sr. tester on your first engagement.

### Goal:

* Use previous knowledge and research techniques to identify and exploit a vulnerability in ACKme’s infrastructure.
* Retrieve a **flag** to complete the challenge.

---

## 🎉 Task 7 - Conclusion

You’ve completed your introduction to:

* What vulnerabilities are
* Types of vulnerabilities
* Scoring frameworks: **CVSS** and **VPR**
* Research resources: **NVD** and **Exploit-DB**
* A hands-on engagement using vulnerability research

You now have a strong foundation for vulnerability research and exploitation in real-world assessments.

Keep practicing and exploring more advanced techniques!
