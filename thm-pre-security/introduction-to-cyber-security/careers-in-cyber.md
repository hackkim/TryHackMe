# Introduction to Cyber Security

This module gave me a high-level overview of what cybersecurity is and why it matters. It introduced the basic ideas behind offensive and defensive security, and helped me understand the various career paths in the field.

Instead of going into too much detail here, I decided to break the content into three separate write-ups:

- [Careers in Cyber](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd1dd269-e4d8-4ddc-8841-abe40a45188c)
- [Offensive Security Intro](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5935732-92d1-47df-94cd-65ec0e58f943)
- [Defensive Security Intro](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b19c449b-49fc-4e61-af56-6cdf9c7d3613)

Each of these files contains my personal summaries, key takeaways, and screenshots from the learning platform.

This was a great way to start the Pre Security path and build motivation to explore deeper topics.
