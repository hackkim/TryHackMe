# 🔧 Exploit Vulnerabilities - Summary

This room introduces methods for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities using both automated and manual techniques. You'll learn about public exploit databases, hands-on tactics, and how to apply those insights to gain remote access and extract sensitive data.

---

## ✅ Task 1 - Introduction

* Learn how vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited
* Discover essential tools and databases
* Apply knowledge in a practical hands-on challenge

---

## 🔢 Task 2 - Automated vs. Manual Vulnerability Research

### 🌐 Automated Scanning

Tools like **Nessus** automate vulnerability discovery across services.

| Advantage                        | Disadvantage                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Fast, scalable, repeatable scans | May encourage overreliance           |
| Results can be shared easily     | Very noisy, can trigger alerts       |
| Open-source tools exist          | Limited by license/features          |
| Broad vulnerability coverage     | Misses complex logic vulnerabilities |

> Tools like **Metasploit** also include built-in vulnerability scanners.

### ✍️ Manual Testing

Used for:

* Application-specific flaws
* Subtle issues missed by automated scanners

Common vulnerabilities:

| Vulnerability              | Description                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Security Misconfigurations | Exposed internal data due to poor settings         |
| Broken Access Control      | Accessing unauthorized features                    |
| Insecure Deserialization   | Executing unintended code through crafted data     |
| Injection (e.g. SQLi)      | Unsafe input directly interpreted by backend logic |

## 📃 Task 3 - Finding Manual Exploits

![Rapid7 Exploit Search](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0129073f-bdf7-4e5f-8362-fd60575665e3)

### 📊 Rapid7

* Vulnerability & exploit database
* Includes instructions for Metasploit modules

![Metasploit Module Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1800b8d-d4de-436f-a24a-d0414a57207f)

### 📄 GitHub

* Contains up-to-date PoCs from independent researchers
* Search with tags like `PoC`, `CVE`, or `vulnerability`
* No quality control: use with caution

### 🔍 Searchsploit

* Offline tool included in Kali/AttackBox
* Mirrors Exploit-DB locally
* Syntax:

```bash
searchsploit wordpress
```

Example output:

```
WordPress Theme Toolbox - SQL Injection | php/webapps/38077.txt
WordPress Theme Uncode - Arbitrary File | php/webapps/39895.php
```

## 🛠️ Task 4 - Example of Manual Exploitation

![Apache Tomcat Logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46f3db95-0beb-41bf-bfe2-6780f85308e1)

Goal: Use a **remote code execution (RCE)** exploit to gain access.

### 🔄 Modify Exploit for Environment

```bash
nano exploit.py
# Before:
mymachine="192.168.1.10"
# After:
mymachine="10.13.37.10"
```

### ⚖️ Understand Usage

```bash
exploit.py --help
# Arguments:
-u : Target URL
-c : Command to execute
```

### ⚡ Exploit Steps

```bash
# Step 1 - Confirm code execution
exploit.py -u http://10.10.10.10 -c "whoami"
> www-data

# Step 2 - Extract flag
exploit.py -u http://10.10.10.10 -c "cat flag.txt"
> THM{EXPLOIT_COMPLETE}
```

---

## 🎯 Task 5 - Practical: Manual Exploitation

1. Deploy the target machine
2. Wait 5 minutes for setup
3. Visit: `http://MACHINE_IP`
4. Perform manual reconnaissance and exploit the application
