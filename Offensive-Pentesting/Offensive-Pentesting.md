## 🚀 Pathway Modules

### 🟢 Getting Started
**Foundation-level penetration testing skills to build your offensive security toolkit.**

![Getting Started Section](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57ef07c1-74b0-4ac8-86b3-10cc399880d2)

**Topics Covered:**
- 🔍 **Active Reconnaissance**: Information gathering and target enumeration
- 🔎 **Vulnerability Scanning**: Identifying security weaknesses in systems
- ⬆️ **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher-level access to compromised systems  
- 🌐 **Web Application Attacks**: Exploiting common web vulnerabilities

*Note: It's important to take notes when attacking machines, as you will usually be required to explain the vulnerabilities to both technical and non-technical audiences. Practice documenting your findings through detailed writeups or blog posts for each room you complete.*

### 🔥 Advanced Exploitation  
**Time to dive deeper into sophisticated attack techniques and methodologies.**

![Advanced Exploitation Section](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f01bf2b-16cb-4f54-bbad-a628ba810412)

**Advanced Topics:**
- 🔎 **Vulnerability Scanning**: Advanced scanning techniques and tool usage
- 🎯 **Handling Public Exploits**: Working with existing exploits and proof-of-concepts
- 🔐 **Password Cracking**: Breaking authentication mechanisms  
- 🛠️ **Metasploit Framework**: Mastering the industry-standard exploitation framework
- 🔀 **Port Redirection**: Traffic manipulation and tunneling techniques

---

### 🪣 Buffer Overflow Exploitation
**Understanding the foundations of memory corruption vulnerabilities.**

![Buffer Overflow Exploitation Section](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cd3046e-4ebc-459c-8f82-fbeabbc7f4cb)

**Core Concepts:**
- 🪟 **Windows Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities**: Understanding memory corruption in Windows environments
- ⚙️ **Basic Exploit Development**: Creating custom exploits from scratch  
- 🎯 **Service Exploitation**: Targeting vulnerable services with buffer overflow attacks

*Buffer overflows are fundamental to many exploits used against vulnerable services. While most exploits are pre-compiled by developers, understanding the underlying principles is crucial for advanced penetration testing.*

---

### 🏢 Active Directory
**Mastering attacks against enterprise Windows environments.**

![Active Directory Section](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/964ce030-85ea-4547-a3ac-c4981b6d87e4)

**Enterprise Attack Vectors:**
- 📚 **Active Directory Basics**: Understanding domain architecture and components
- 🎫 **Attacking Kerberos**: Exploiting authentication protocol weaknesses
- 👑 **Exploiting Domain Controllers**: Targeting the heart of AD infrastructure  
- 🔄 **Post-Exploitation Tasks**: Maintaining persistence and lateral movement

*Active Directory environments dominate corporate and governmental organizational networking structures. Understanding how to attack and exploit these systems is essential for enterprise penetration testing.*
