## 📌 Detailed Contents

### 📘 Pentesting Fundamentals

**Task 1: What is Penetration Testing?**

Penetration testing (pentesting) involves systematically evaluating the security of IT infrastructure by simulating attacks to identify vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. It helps organizations understand their security posture and address weaknesses proactively.

This section introduces critical concepts and ethical considerations essential for every penetration test. Key highlights include:

* **Ethical Hacking Principles**: Understanding the legality, permissions, and responsibilities of penetration testing.
* **Methodologies**: Familiarizing yourself with structured approaches such as Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining Access, Maintaining Access, and Covering Tracks.
* **Practical Skills**: Developing the foundational skills to effectively conduct and document penetration tests.

### 🛡️ Penetration Testing Ethics

**Task 2: Penetration Testing Ethics**

Understanding legality and ethical considerations is essential in penetration testing.

![Ethical considerations](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/298c7977-b520-4ad3-bb71-da8201cc8dd5)

**Key highlights include:**

* **Authorization and Permission:** Clear legal permissions from system owners before testing.

* **Rules of Engagement (ROE):** Establishing a document to outline the permissible methods and testing boundaries.

### 📋 Penetration Testing Methodologies

**Task 3: Penetration Testing Methodologies**

Understanding and applying structured penetration testing methodologies ensures comprehensive assessments.

* **OSSTMM:** Provides detailed testing strategies for various security assessments, covering telecommunications, wired, and wireless networks.

### 📦 Black box, White box, Grey box Penetration Testing

**Task 4: Types of Penetration Testing**

Penetration tests can be classified by the amount of information provided to the tester:

* **Black-Box Testing:** No internal knowledge provided; simulates an external attacker.

![Black-Box](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91bad202-16e7-419e-a546-194aac230a9a)

* **Grey-Box Testing:** Partial internal knowledge provided; simulates an insider threat scenario.

![Grey-Box](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6a8c27c-5810-44ed-8804-940db676c865)

* **White-Box Testing:** Full internal knowledge provided; comprehensive internal audit scenario.

### 🔒 Principles of Security

Explore the fundamental principles of information security aimed at securing data and protecting systems from potential threats. This segment covers:

* **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)**: Core principles for maintaining secure and reliable systems.
* **Defense in Depth**: Implementing multiple layers of security to create robust and secure environments.
* **Risk Management**: Techniques and strategies to identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential risks and vulnerabilities.
