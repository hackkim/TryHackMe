# 🛡️ TryHackMe Pre Security Path: My First Step into Cybersecurity

I recently completed the **Pre Security Path** on TryHackMe — an excellent starting point for anyone interested in cybersecurity.

This learning path focuses on building the foundational technical knowledge required to understand and explore the world of cyber attacks and defenses. It’s beginner-friendly, hands-on, and structured in a way that makes learning genuinely enjoyable.

### 🚀 What’s Next?

Now that I’ve laid the groundwork, I’m ready to dive into more advanced content:  
- Web application hacking  
- Bug bounty  
- Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges  
- Real-world penetration testing scenarios

I’ll also continue writing about what I learn — not just to share with others, but to reinforce it for myself.
