# ðŸ”’ Principles of Security

## Task 1: Introduction

This document explores foundational principles of information security, emphasizing various frameworks, measures, and protocols crucial to safeguarding data and systems. These security mechanisms collectively contribute to **"Defence in Depth,"** a strategy that employs multiple security layers to provide redundancy and reinforce organizational security.

## Task 2: The CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is an established model integral to developing comprehensive security policies. It consists of three essential elements: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

### ðŸ”¹ Confidentiality

![Confidentiality](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d2b98e9-cb4f-49fc-86ec-3fed4cd70881)

Confidentiality ensures data protection from unauthorized access. Examples include:

* **Employee records:** Restricted to HR administrators
* **Accounting documents:** Restricted access based on sensitivity
* **Government documents:** Classified into top-secret, classified, or unclassified based on sensitivity

### ðŸ”¹ Integrity

![Integrity](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fabc0319-d864-4414-ad74-a7f92bc897c9)

Integrity ensures the accuracy and consistency of data unless modified by authorized personnel. Potential threats include unauthorized access, accidental errors, or system malfunctions. Safeguards include:

* **Strict access controls**
* **Hash verifications**
* **Digital signatures**

### ðŸ”¹ Availability

![Availability](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93e62c8a-1348-44e6-98fa-4b5ba2278502)

Availability ensures authorized users have timely and reliable access to information when needed. This involves:

* **Reliable, tested hardware** (e.g., reputable servers)
* **Redundant technologies** to mitigate primary system failures
* **Comprehensive security protocols** to prevent service disruption

## Task 3: Principles of Privileges

![Principles of Privileges](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c1d7c04-2f0c-409a-a179-87c898c5ff4a)

Accurately defining and managing access privileges is critical. Privilege levels are determined by:

* Individual roles and responsibilities within the organization
* Data sensitivity

### ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts

* **Privileged Identity Management (PIM):** Assigning system access based on organizational roles
* **Privileged Access Management (PAM):** Managing system access privileges, password management, auditing, and attack surface reduction

### ðŸ”¹ Principle of Least Privilege

The principle dictates that users should only receive the minimum privileges required for their roles. This practice minimizes the risk of unauthorized or unintended data access and changes.

---

## Task 4: Security Models

Security models formalize processes to achieve confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### ðŸ”¹ Bell-La Padula Model

* **Objective:** Ensures confidentiality
* **Rule:** "No write down, no read up"
* **Use Cases:** Typically adopted in government and military sectors where hierarchical access control and strict confidentiality are required

![Bell-La Padula Model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a62ed4ac-2390-4c4d-ad45-03a5564c57bb)

| Advantages                          | Disadvantages                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Reflects organizational hierarchies | Awareness of inaccessible information existence |
| Simple to implement                 | Requires significant organizational trust       |

### ðŸ”¹ Biba Model

* **Objective:** Ensures integrity
* **Rule:** "No write up, no read down"
* **Use Cases:** Preferred in environments emphasizing data integrity, e.g., software development

![Biba Model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e908e48-f8c4-45c1-ac55-754182a7d093)

| Advantages                                            | Disadvantages                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Easy implementation                                   | Complexity in managing access levels |
| Enhances integrity alongside confidentiality controls | Possible operational inefficiencies  |

## Task 5: Threat Modelling & Incident Response

### ðŸ”¹ Threat Modelling

Threat modelling proactively identifies, mitigates, and reviews cybersecurity threats. Effective threat modelling includes:

![Threat Modelling Process](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f658a876-e0ee-414c-951c-9731a2355c48)

* **Preparation**
* **Identification**
* **Mitigation**
* **Review**

#### Frameworks

* **STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)**
* **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**

### STRIDE Principles Detailed

| Principle              | Description                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spoofing               | Ensuring authentication; preventing false identity claims            |
| Tampering              | Protecting data integrity through anti-tampering measures            |
| Repudiation            | Activity logging and tracking                                        |
| Information Disclosure | Restricting data visibility to authorized users only                 |
| Denial of Service      | Protecting resources from being overwhelmed and becoming unavailable |
| Elevation of Privilege | Preventing unauthorized access escalation                            |

### ðŸ”¹ Incident Response (IR)

Incident Response (IR) addresses security breaches systematically, minimizing damage and preventing recurrence. Incident classification is based on urgency and impact:

![Incident Classification Matrix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5614762e-6d2a-47cc-8690-041a290a6c7a)

The six-phase IR approach:

| Action          | Description                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Preparation     | Ensuring readiness with resources and response plans            |
| Identification  | Detecting and identifying the nature and origin of the incident |
| Containment     | Limiting incident spread and impact                             |
| Eradication     | Removing the threat from affected systems                       |
| Recovery        | Restoring operations to normal                                  |
| Lessons Learned | Evaluating response effectiveness for future improvements       |

### Incident Response Team

The **Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)** is responsible for managing incidents, assessing urgency and impact, and executing the response plan effectively.
