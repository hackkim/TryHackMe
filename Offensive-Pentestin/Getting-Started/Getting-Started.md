# 🟢 Getting Started - Offensive Pentesting Rooms

> **Foundation-level penetration testing skills to build your offensive security toolkit.**

![Getting Started Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bff1a37f-5f27-4d72-9e82-63fb03623ea7)

Let's get started with a few easy rooms which will give you practice in the following areas:
- 🔍 **Active Reconnaissance**: Information gathering and target enumeration
- 🔎 **Vulnerability Scanning**: Identifying security weaknesses in systems
- ⬆️ **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher-level access to compromised systems  
- 🌐 **Web Application Attacks**: Exploiting common web vulnerabilities

**⚠️ Important Note**: *It's important to take notes when attacking machines, as you will usually be required to explain the vulnerabilities to both a technical and non-technical audience. To get practice, why not take notes or write a blog post for each room you complete?*
