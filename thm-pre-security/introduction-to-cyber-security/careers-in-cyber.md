## Task 3: Security Engineer
![Security Engineer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/604bbc8a-a688-4972-9165-e208100bd7ed)
Security engineers use threat and vulnerability data to develop and implement security solutions, often provided by other security team members. They bypass a wide range of attacks including web application attacks, network threats, and evolving tactics and strategies. Their ultimate goal is to adopt and maintain measures to mitigate attack and data loss risks.

### Responsibilities
- Test and review security measures across software systems.
- Monitor networks and reports to update systems and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Identify and implement systems needed for optimal security.

### Learning Path
- SOC Level 1
- JR Penetration Tester
- Offensive Pentesting

## Task 4: Incident Responder
![Incident Responder](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce55038a-a775-4ad1-b3a5-9da40cb55e88)
Incident responders handle security breaches efficiently and productively. Their responsibilities include creating plans, policies, and protocols that are enforced during and after a cyber incident. This role requires real-time assessment and action under high pressure. Key metrics include MTTD (Mean Time to Detect), MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge), and MTTR (Mean Time to Respond), all of which help mitigate the impact of attacks.

### Responsibilities
- Develop and implement actionable incident response plans.
- Maintain strong security practices and support response measures.
- Document post-incident reports and integrate lessons learned to prepare for future attacks.

### Learning Path
- SOC Level 1

## Task 5: Digital Forensics Investigator
![Digital Forensics Investigator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e6f58a4-1019-4e78-907f-741ecd91432e)

If you enjoy being a detective, this role may be perfect for you. Working in law enforcement, you'll collect and analyze evidence to help solve crimes‚Äîbringing the guilty to justice and clearing the innocent. In a corporate setting, you'll analyze incidents like policy violations using forensic techniques.

### Responsibilities
- Collect digital evidence while following legal procedures.
- Analyze digital evidence to uncover answers about an incident.
- Document your findings and report on the case.

## Task 6: Malware Analyst
![Malware Analyst](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a55b33c2-c243-4bcf-bc3b-120d0fdd0604)
A malware analyst investigates suspicious programs to discover their functions and document findings. Also known as a reverse-engineer, they convert compiled machine code into readable formats, often in low-level languages. This role requires a solid background in low-level programming, especially in assembly and C.

### Responsibilities
- Conduct **static analysis** by reverse-engineering malicious code.
- Perform **dynamic analysis** by observing malware behavior in a controlled environment.
- Document and report all findings.

## Task 7: Penetration Tester
![Penetration Tester](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25382fc7-d883-4c54-8e84-f54e3a4363c0)
Penetration testing (or pentesting/ethical hacking) involves testing system and software security by simulating cyberattacks. Testers identify and exploit vulnerabilities to assess risks, enabling organizations to fix flaws before real attacks occur.

### Responsibilities
- Test computer systems, networks, and web applications.
- Perform security assessments, audits, and analyze security policies.
- Evaluate and report on findings, recommending actions for mitigation.

### Learning Paths
- JR Penetration Tester
- Offensive Pentesting

## Task 8: Red Teamer
![Red Teamer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/470b5c08-476b-438d-af5d-8223360eafd4)
Red teamers share similarities with penetration testers but focus on simulating real-world attack scenarios to test detection and response. Their tasks include mimicking threat actors, evading detection, and retaining access. Red teaming assessments often run for weeks and are typically conducted by external experts for mature security programs.

### Responsibilities
- Emulate threat actors to uncover vulnerabilities, maintain access, and avoid detection.
- Assess security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures.
- Provide actionable data to improve the organization's real-world defense.

### Learning Paths
- JR Penetration Tester
- Offensive Pentesting
- Red Teamer
