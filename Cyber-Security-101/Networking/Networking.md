## ✅ Completed Rooms

![Networking Concepts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8abd3895-9555-4a2e-9111-a1cdd7d34d9d)

### 1. **Networking Concepts**
- Overview of the OSI model and TCP/IP protocol suite
- Learned the difference between 7-layer and 4-layer models
- Key terms: encapsulation, segmentation, ports, IP addressing

---

![Networking Essentials](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/affc760f-7111-4f5e-b6be-9028b55084bb)

### 2. **Networking Essentials**
- Explored DHCP, DNS, ARP, and routing basics
- Understood how packets are configured and routed
- Identified roles of MAC and IP addresses in local/remote comms

---

![Networking Core Protocols](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c128a08-019b-40ab-a23d-3ce1ecd946cd)

### 3. **Networking Core Protocols**
- Studied TCP, UDP, ICMP and their packet structures
- Learned how reliable and connectionless protocols differ
- Practiced basic analysis using packet data

---

![Networking Secure Protocols](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c90fe019-a485-4469-970f-803120e217eb)

### 4. **Networking Secure Protocols**
- Compared plaintext protocols vs encrypted alternatives
- Covered: TLS, SSH, HTTPS, and VPN tunneling
- Emphasized importance of using secure protocols in real networks

---

![Wireshark](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7625876-7fe5-497b-b4af-19d596bc44be)

### 5. **Wireshark: The Basics**
- Capturing and analyzing traffic using Wireshark
- Applied filters to examine TCP, DNS, and HTTP traffic
- Interpreted packet headers and payloads

---

![Tcpdump](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45ab88f0-a6f4-4191-916c-8b26ec690a1c)

### 6. **Tcpdump: The Basics**
- CLI-based packet capture and analysis
- Syntax practice: `tcpdump -i eth0 port 80`, `-nn -vvv -X`
- Learned how to redirect captured data to `.pcap` files

---

![Nmap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de76dc51-40b5-4dd5-ac2d-c152c5135cb9)

### 7. **Nmap: The Basics**
- Host discovery and port scanning with Nmap
- Scanning types: SYN scan, version scan, OS detection
- Interpreting scan output to identify services and vulnerabilities

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Strong foundation in how data travels over networks
- Confident in analyzing packets both graphically (Wireshark) and via CLI (tcpdump)
- Built skills essential for red teaming, CTFs, and penetration testing
