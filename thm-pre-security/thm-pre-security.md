# Introduction to Cyber Security

This post covers the "Introduction to Cyber Security" module from TryHackMe's Pre Security path.
I broke it down into three major sections to better understand and reflect on what I learned:

## 🧑‍💻 Careers in Cyber
Learned about the different job roles available in cybersecurity:

- **SOC Analyst** – First line of defense, monitoring and responding to alerts
- **Penetration Tester** – Finds vulnerabilities in systems by simulating attacks
- **Security Engineer** – Builds and maintains security systems
- **Incident Responder** – Reacts quickly to cyberattacks and investigates what happened

> 📝 I enjoyed seeing the variety of paths — it helped me think about where I might fit.

## 🗡️ Offensive Security Intro
This part gave me a beginner-friendly introduction to "ethical hacking." I practiced:

- Using a web hacking lab to explore basic vulnerabilities
- Thinking like an attacker to understand weaknesses
- The importance of **legality** and **permission** in hacking!

> 💡 This was exciting — my first taste of hacking in a legal environment.
