# 🛡️ TryHackMe Pre Security Path: My First Step into Cybersecurity

I recently completed the **Pre Security Path** on TryHackMe — an excellent starting point for anyone interested in cybersecurity.

This learning path focuses on building the foundational technical knowledge required to understand and explore the world of cyber attacks and defenses. It’s beginner-friendly, hands-on, and structured in a way that makes learning genuinely enjoyable.

### 🚀 What’s Next?

Now that I’ve completed the Pre Security path, I plan to continue my cybersecurity journey with a stronger focus. My next steps include:

- Starting the **Cyber Security Foundations** path on TryHackMe  
- Diving into the **Cyber Security 101** module to strengthen my core understanding  
- Practicing Linux and web hacking techniques in lab environments  
- Joining beginner-friendly **CTF competitions** to test my skills  
- Writing detailed blog posts as I learn to build a strong portfolio— not just to share with others, but to reinforce it for myself.
