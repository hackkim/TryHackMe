# 🛡️ TryHackMe - Vulnerability Scanner Overview

> This document provides a comprehensive explanation of vulnerability scanning fundamentals, types, tools, and hands-on practice using OpenVAS.

---

## 🧠 Task 1 - What Are Vulnerabilities?

Vulnerabilities are **flaws, weaknesses, or misconfigurations** in a system’s software or hardware that can be exploited by an attacker to compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

### 🏠 Analogy


![Vulnerability in a House (Analogy)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41b05611-3fa1-45d0-8471-0ce66896a3da)

![Broken Chain - System Weakness](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d01dc9ce-e25c-4d6c-943e-3403e5c2b198)


Think of a house with holes in the roof. Rain, dust, and insects can easily enter. Similarly, vulnerabilities act as **entry points for attackers**.

- 🔧 **Patching** is the process of fixing these vulnerabilities.
- 📉 Ignoring them can lead to **data breaches, system downtime, or malware infections**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand what vulnerability scanning is
- Identify different types of vulnerability scans
- Learn about leading vulnerability scanning tools
- Use OpenVAS for a hands-on vulnerability assessment

---

## 🔎 Task 2 - Vulnerability Scanning

### ❓ What is Vulnerability Scanning?

It is the **systematic examination of systems and networks** to identify known vulnerabilities using an automated tool.

### ✅ Why Scan?

- Prevent exploit attempts
- Maintain regulatory compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
- Improve overall security hygiene

---

### 📊 Types of Vulnerability Scanning

#### 1. 🔐 Authenticated vs 🚫 Unauthenticated Scans

![Authenticated Scan](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/306182b6-2854-4f35-8c75-4ebb8ce0559d)
![Unauthenticated Scan](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41ebcd32-fa88-4ae3-88fd-d4713d482713)

| Attribute | Authenticated | Unauthenticated |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Access | Uses valid credentials | No credentials used |
| Depth | Deep scan of internal configs | Surface-level assessment |
| Use Case | Internal audits | External perimeter scanning |
| Example | Scanning internal DB with creds | Scanning public web server without login |

---

#### 2. 🏠 Internal vs 🌍 External Scans

![Internal Scan Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a0fba9c-88cb-494c-b7f3-aa045e3ef786)
![External Scan Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e628fbc5-c8e3-4975-8718-f7e63faff721)


| Attribute | Internal | External |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Scanner Location | Inside the network | Outside the network |
| Perspective | Insider threat simulation | Outsider threat emulation |
| Use Case | Check lateral movement risks | Identify publicly exposed services |
| Example | Scanning HR systems | Scanning public DNS or VPN portals |

> ✅ Best practice: Run both internal & external scans regularly.

---

### 🗂️ Reporting Capabilities

Most scanners provide:

- Vulnerability summary with **CVE, CVSS, and description**
- Affected system list and severity breakdown
- Export formats: PDF, XML, HTML, CSV
- Some include remediation steps

---

## 🧾 Task 4 - CVE & CVSS

### 📘 CVE: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

![CVE Number Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e183ed42-c1d1-41e6-8550-8683cdcd55b8)

- Created by MITRE
- Each vulnerability is assigned a unique ID
- Format: `CVE-YYYY-NNNNN`
- Example: `CVE-2024-12345`

You can query CVEs at:
> https://cve.mitre.org/

---

### 📊 CVSS: Common Vulnerability Scoring System

Used to quantify the severity of vulnerabilities.

| CVSS Score | Severity |
|------------|----------|
| 0.0–3.9    | Low      |
| 4.0–6.9    | Medium   |
| 7.0–8.9    | High     |
| 9.0–10.0   | Critical |

- CVSS is calculated based on:
  - **Attack vector**
  - **Complexity**
  - **Privileges required**
  - **Impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability**
