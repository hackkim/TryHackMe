# 🏴‍☠️ Vulnversity 

A comprehensive guide covering active reconnaissance, web application attacks, and privilege escalation techniques using the Vulnversity machine from TryHackMe.

## 🎯 Overview

This walkthrough demonstrates essential penetration testing methodologies including network scanning, directory enumeration, file upload vulnerabilities, and Linux privilege escalation. The target is a vulnerable web application that simulates real-world security weaknesses.

## 🚀 Task 1: Machine Deployment

Start by deploying the target machine and ensuring proper network connectivity. Allow 4-5 minutes for the VM to fully boot before proceeding with the assessment.

## 🔍 Task 2: Reconnaissance with Nmap

Network reconnaissance is the foundation of any penetration test. We'll use Nmap to identify open services and potential attack vectors.

### 📡 Basic Service Scan

```bash
nmap -sV MACHINE_IP
```

### ⚙️ Nmap Flag Reference

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-sV` | Attempts to determine service versions |
| `-p <x>` or `-p-` | Scan specific port or all ports |
| `-Pn` | Disable host discovery |
| `-A` | Enable OS detection and script scanning |
| `-sC` | Use default Nmap scripts |
| `-v` | Verbose output |
| `-sU` | UDP port scan |
| `-sS` | TCP SYN scan |

## 🕷️ Task 3: Directory Discovery with Gobuster

Directory enumeration reveals hidden paths that may contain sensitive functionality or files.

### 🛠️ Installation and Setup

```bash
# On Kali Linux
sudo apt-get install gobuster

# Basic directory scan
gobuster dir -u http://MACHINE_IP:3333 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt
```

### 📋 Gobuster Parameters

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-e` | Print full URLs |
| `-u` | Target URL |
| `-w` | Wordlist path |
| `-U` and `-P` | Basic authentication credentials |
| `-p <x>` | Proxy configuration |
| `-c <cookies>` | Cookie specification |

## ⚡ Task 4: Web Application Exploitation

Once we've identified an upload functionality, we can exploit it to gain initial access to the system.

### 📝 File Extension Testing

Create a wordlist containing common PHP extensions:

![PHP Extensions List](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afcf906b-f4f9-435d-81c2-5d543dfaf1a2)

```
.php
.php3
.php4
.php5
.phtml
```

### 🔧 Burp Suite Configuration

Use Burp Suite's Intruder module to test which file extensions are accepted by the upload form:

1. 🕸️ Capture the upload request in Burp Suite
2. 📤 Send to Intruder
3. 🎯 Configure "Sniper" attack type
4. 📍 Set payload positions around the file extension
5. 📋 Load the extension wordlist
6. ⚡ Execute the attack to identify allowed extensions

### 🐚 Reverse Shell Implementation

After identifying an accepted extension (`.phtml`), deploy a PHP reverse shell:

1. 📥 Download and modify a PHP reverse shell
2. 🔧 Update the IP address to your attacking machine's IP
3. 📛 Rename the file with the accepted extension
4. 👂 Set up a netcat listener:

```bash
nc -lvnp 1234
```

5. 🚀 Upload and execute the shell by navigating to the uploaded file

## 👑 Task 5: Privilege Escalation

With initial access established, the next goal is to escalate privileges to root.

### 🔐 Understanding SUID

SUID (Set User ID) permissions allow programs to execute with the privileges of the file owner rather than the user running them.

### 🎯 SUID Exploitation Strategy

1. **🔍 Identify SUID binaries:**
```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

2. **🔬 Analyze potential vectors:**
   - Look for unusual SUID binaries
   - Check GTFOBins for exploitation techniques
   - Test for command injection opportunities

3. **🚀 Execute privilege escalation:**
   - Exploit identified SUID binary
   - Gain root shell access
   - Retrieve flags and complete objectives

## 💡 Key Learning Points

- **🔍 Reconnaissance is crucial:** Thorough enumeration often reveals the attack path
- **🛡️ Web application security:** File upload restrictions can often be bypassed
- **👑 Privilege escalation:** SUID binaries are common escalation vectors in CTF environments
- **🛠️ Tool proficiency:** Mastering tools like Nmap, Gobuster, and Burp Suite is essential

## 🎉 Conclusion

This walkthrough demonstrates a typical web application penetration testing methodology. The progression from reconnaissance through exploitation to privilege escalation mirrors real-world assessment scenarios. Understanding these techniques helps in both offensive security operations and defensive security implementations.
