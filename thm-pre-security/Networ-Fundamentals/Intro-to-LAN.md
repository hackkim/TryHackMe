## üè∑Ô∏è Task 1: LAN Topologies + Switches & Routers

### 1. LAN Topologies

A **network topology** describes how devices connect within a LAN.  
Common topologies include:

1. **Star Topology**  
   - All devices connect to a central hub or switch.  
   - ‚úÖ Easy to expand  
   - ‚ùå If the central device fails, the entire network can fail

2. **Bus Topology**  
   - All devices share a single backbone cable.  
   - ‚úÖ Simple and inexpensive  
   - ‚ùå One break can bring down the whole network

3. **Ring Topology**  
   - Devices form a closed loop; data travels in one direction.  
   - ‚úÖ Reduced collisions  
   - ‚ùå One fault disrupts the entire ring

### 2. What is a Switch?

A **Switch** is a device that connects multiple devices within a LAN and forwards data based on **MAC addresses**.

- Operates at **Layer 2** (Data Link layer) of the OSI model  
- Maintains a MAC address table to reduce unnecessary traffic  
- Modern LANs typically use switches for efficiency

### 3. What is a Router?

A **Router** connects different networks (e.g., LAN to the Internet) and forwards data packets based on **IP addresses**.

- Operates at **Layer 3** (Network layer) of the OSI model  
- Uses routing tables to find the best path  
- Performs **NAT** (Network Address Translation) for multiple LAN hosts to share one public IP

## üß© Task 2: A Primer on Subnetting

**Subnetting** is the practice of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks for:

- **Efficiency** (smaller broadcast domains)  
- **Security** (isolating sensitive segments)  
- **Manageability** (allocating IP ranges by department)

Example:  
Split a corporate network into subnets for different teams or a caf√© network into Staff vs. Guest subnets.

## üîÑ Task 3: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

**ARP** maps IP addresses to MAC addresses within the same LAN.

1. **ARP Request** ‚Äì Broadcast: ‚ÄúWho has 192.168.1.10?‚Äù  
2. **ARP Reply** ‚Äì The device with that IP responds with its MAC address.

Devices store these mappings in an ARP cache for quicker lookups.

## üì° Task 4: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

**DHCP** automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS server info to devices.

Typical workflow:

1. **DHCP Discover** ‚Äì Client broadcasts to find a DHCP server.  
2. **DHCP Offer** ‚Äì Server offers an IP lease.  
3. **DHCP Request** ‚Äì Client requests the offered IP.  
4. **DHCP ACK** ‚Äì Server confirms the IP assignment.

**Advantages**:

- No manual IP configuration  
- Avoid IP conflicts  
- Centralized IP management

## üìå Conclusion

In this **Intro to LAN** room, you explored:

- **LAN Topologies** (Star, Bus, Ring)
- **Switches** (Layer 2) and **Routers** (Layer 3)
- **Subnetting** for dividing networks
- **ARP** to resolve IP-to-MAC
- **DHCP** for automatic IP assignment

Mastering these fundamentals is essential before moving on to advanced networking topics like VLANs, routing protocols, and network security tools.
