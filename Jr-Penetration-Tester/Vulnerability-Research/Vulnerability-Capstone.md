**Scenario:**
Ackme Support Inc. has recently launched a new blog site. Before publishing content, the development team has requested a thorough **security audit**.

**Your Objective:**

* Identify vulnerabilities on the web server
* Exploit discovered flaws
* Submit the captured **flag**

This room serves as a final review of your ability to:

* Perform vulnerability assessments
* Leverage automated and manual tools
* Research and apply public exploits

---

## 🌐 Task 2 - Exploit the Machine (Flag Submission)

1. **Deploy** the virtual machine by clicking **Start Machine**
2. Wait **at least 5 minutes** for full initialization
3. Use the provided **MACHINE\_IP** to begin testing:

   * Visit `http://MACHINE_IP` in your browser
   * Perform reconnaissance
   * Enumerate application and technologies
   * Identify any vulnerabilities (e.g., version disclosure, misconfigurations)
   * Research public exploits (e.g., Exploit-DB, GitHub)
   * Execute the exploit (manual or scripted)

> 🎯 **Goal:** Retrieve and submit the flag found through exploitation

Recommended tools:

* `nmap`, `nikto`, `whatweb`, `gobuster`
* `Searchsploit`, `curl`, `python`, `burp`

Complete this room to validate your practical understanding of vulnerability discovery, research, and exploitation in a realistic engagement context.

Good luck! 🚀
