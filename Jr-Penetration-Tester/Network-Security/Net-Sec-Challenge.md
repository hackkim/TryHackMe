# ðŸ”§ Net Sec Challenge

Use this challenge to validate and reinforce your skills from the **Network Security** module. You are expected to rely only on three tools:

* `nmap`
* `telnet`
* `hydra`

---

## âœ… Task 1 - Introduction

Start the target machine and get ready to apply your knowledge practically. This room is designed as a self-assessment. Make sure you are comfortable with the following concepts before proceeding:

* Active vs Passive Reconnaissance
* Service and version detection
* Port scanning
* Protocol interaction via Telnet
* Password brute-forcing with Hydra

---

## ðŸŽ“ Task 2 - Challenge Questions

You can answer the following challenge questions using only:

* `nmap` â€“ to enumerate open ports, identify services, and detect versions
* `telnet` â€“ to interact with services that communicate via text protocols (e.g., HTTP, SMTP, POP3)
* `hydra` â€“ to brute-force password-protected services like FTP, SSH, and login prompts

Use these tools to:

1. Identify open and filtered ports
2. Discover the services and versions running on those ports
3. Test login credentials with common usernames and passwords

## ðŸŽ‰ Task 3 - Summary

Congratulations! ðŸŒŸ

In this Network Security module, you have learned:

* Passive and Active Reconnaissance fundamentals
* Practical use of `nmap` for scanning, enumeration, and fingerprinting
* Protocol-level understanding via `telnet`
* Login attack automation with `hydra`

You are now equipped with the basic offensive tools and methodologies needed for network-based assessments.

Keep practicing and advancing to more sophisticated attack surfaces!
